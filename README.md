# README
This is a readme file. It typically includes some information about your project. 
For more information about readmes, you can either [read a guide](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/blob/18f-pages/pages/making-readmes-readable.md) or have a look at the readmes of popular open-source projects such as [Swift by Apple](https://github.com/apple/swift) or [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

Readme files are typically formatted in Markdown. 
However, there are platform-specific flavors, so for this project, you can make full use of the [Gitlab markdown syntax](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html), for example when talking about a :bug: (bug) or if your code is slow like a :snail:.
You can also tag people using @username and reference issues using '#1', where 1 is the issue number. For more features, consult the linked Gitlab syntax guide.
